This is the whole of what passes between sim-mesh and a firmware. A firmware
that keeps it runs on sim-mesh with nothing of it in sim-mesh; sim-mesh that
keeps it runs any such firmware. **Must**, **must not** and **may** are
requirements; everything else describes. It is also

## 1. The firmware zip

A firmware is one station build for one architecture: a zip archive named

```
<base>_<arch>_<version>.zip
```

- **base**: lower-case letters `a`–`z`, digits, `-` and `.`, starting with
  a letter or digit; never `_`. Two builds that differ in anything sim-mesh
  does not read, the virtual radio they drive among it, are two bases; by
  custom the base ends with the radio (`relay-sx1262`).
- **arch**: the architecture it runs on, as `uname -m` spells it on Linux:
  `aarch64`, `x86_64`.
- **version**: either a build stamp, the UTC time of the build as
  `YYYYMMDDhhmmss` (fourteen digits), or a semantic version
  `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` with an optional `-pre-release`. A base **must** keep
  to one of the two.

The name splits at its first and its last `_`. Installed, the firmware is the
directory `firmware/<base>_<arch>_<version>/`, the zip unpacked, so a zip and
its installed directory have one name. `<base>_latest` means the newest
installed firmware of exactly that base for the machine: by stamp, or by
semantic version (a pre-release before its release).

Members sit at the archive's root, with forward-slash paths that **must**
stay inside it (no absolute path, no `..`). It holds `node.yaml`, the
executable, the driver, and whatever else the station runs. A member's Unix
permission bits, where the archive records them, are the file's; the
executable is made executable whatever the archive says.

A zip is refused when it is built for another architecture than the
machine's, when its base already holds firmware versioned the other way,
when a firmware of its name is installed already, and when its `node.yaml`,
or anything it names, is missing.

## 2. node.yaml

A YAML mapping at the archive's root.

| Key | Required | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `base` | yes | as in the name |
| `arch` | yes | as in the name |
| `version` | yes | as in the name, a string |
| `category` | yes | the driver interface its driver implements, and so the verbs it answers: `reticulum` (§7); `meshcore`, `meshtastic` to come |
| `exec` | yes | the executable's path in the archive |
| `driver` | yes | the driver's path in the archive, a Python file (§6) |
| `radio` | no | the virtual radio it is linked with, by the library's name: `sx1262` is `libsimradio-sx1262.so` (§9). Absent: sim-mesh provides none, and the station speaks the ether's protocol itself (§8) or has no radio |
| `fixed` | no | the path of a read-only data tree in the archive, which its driver may hand the station |
| `env` | no | a mapping of environment variable to value, given to the station after sim-mesh's own (§3); a value starting `./` or `../` is a path in the installed firmware. `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` here is put before sim-mesh's, not instead of it |
| `title` | no | what the page calls it (`Relay 2.1 (dev)`) |
| `hardware` | no | the hardware it plays (`ESP32-S3`), shown as “virtual ESP32-S3” |

Other keys are kept and not read.

## 3. What a station is given

sim-mesh starts the executable with its argument list from the driver (§6),
its working directory its own (below), its stdin and stdout one pty (§4),
and this environment: the host's, then these, then node.yaml's `env`, then
the driver's `env`.

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `SIM_MESH_NODE_ID` | a small integer, unique on the host: the station's id in the ether (its `sid`), and the last bytes of any MAC address it makes |
| `SIM_MESH_NODE_DIR` | its directory and working directory; its state lives under `state/` |
| `SIM_MESH_BIND_ADDR` | its own loopback address, fixed by its id; every socket it opens **must** bind here |
| `SIM_MESH_ETHER` | `host:port` of the ether |
| `SIM_MESH_RADIO_LIB` | the path of the virtual radio its node.yaml names; its directory is first on `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` |
| `SIM_MESH_BOARD` | the board its node is, one flat JSON object: `chip`, `max_dbm` (the most at the antenna connector), and above 22 dBm a GC1109 front end's `fem_part`, `fem_tx_cal` (chip register → connector dBm), `fem_gain_db` and `fem_rx_gain_db`. The virtual radio applies the front end from it; a firmware that drives a front end takes its figures from here |
| `SIM_MESH_TIME` | `virtual` in a virtual-time run, absent in a real-time one |
| `SIM_MESH_EPOCH_US` | virtual time: the wall-clock microseconds T 0 stands for |
| `SIM_MESH_SEED` | virtual time: the run's seed; the time shim keys the station's `getentropy`/`getrandom` by it and the node id |
| `LD_PRELOAD` | virtual time: the time shim, `libsimclock.so` (§5) |
| `SIM_MESH_IDLE` | set by a driver whose station does not call `simradio_idle()` itself: `threads`, and the shim says the station is idle when every thread is blocked |
| `SIM_MESH_CLOCK_PROFILE` | optional, from node.yaml's `env`, or from simd's `--clock-ppm` (a crystal off by a draw within that many parts per million, per station), node.yaml's winning: node time as a function of T, `T:node,T:node,…` in microseconds, both increasing, slope 1 outside the points; absent, node time is T |

A station reads its identity from these and from nowhere else, so two
stations on one host never collide. **A station never learns where it
stands**: its position is the ether's and the loss table's alone.

**What a station may count on.** sim-mesh runs everything in its own image,
the same on every machine: Ubuntu 24.04 of the host's own architecture. An
executable **may** count on its C library and C++ runtime (`libc`, `libm`,
`libstdc++`, `libgcc_s`), on the radio library node.yaml names, on the time
shim, and on the image's `python3`, CPython 3.12 with its standard library
(its driver runs in it, with `aiohttp` and `pyyaml` beside `sim_mesh`).
Anything else it loads **must** be in its zip: a shared library under `lib/`
with `env: {LD_LIBRARY_PATH: ./lib}`, a Python package under a directory it
puts on `PYTHONPATH`, built for CPython 3.12; a firmware written in Python
may use the image's interpreter and need bring none. A zip **must not**
carry a radio library.

## 4. The process

- **stdin and stdout are the console**: a pty, text, shown in the map's
  console window and appended to `log` in its directory, and handed to its
  driver line by line (`console_line`). The one binary thing that may cross
  it is a framed RPC frame, which sim-mesh takes out of the stream before
  anything else sees it (§6). A driver may ask for a pipe each way instead
  (`console_tty`).
- **Exit to reboot.** sim-mesh starts the executable again, on the same
  directory and address, half a second later (of T, in a virtual-time run).
- **State is its directory.** A new simulation starts it with an empty
  `state/`, or with one a snapshot kept; a factory reset empties it; a reset
  leaves it.
- **Ports are its own**, on its own address. A web UI is on the port its
  driver names (`web_port`), reached through sim-mesh's proxy as
  `<node>.<simulation>.sim.localhost:8800`.
- **It may be several processes.** A process it starts that waits on time
  joins a virtual-time run as a station of its own, under the id its driver
  names for it (`sids`), with the same address, the time shim and
  `SIM_MESH_IDLE=threads`: it opens its link (`simradio_station_open`) and,
  with no radio, no chip. Which of them reads the console is the driver's to
  name (`console_sid`).

## 5. Time

In a real-time run a station keeps the host's time. In a virtual-time run the
ether owns conductor time T and moves it only when every station is idle
(§8), and a station keeps four promises:

- **It reads time only through the C library or the radio library.** The
  time shim answers `clock_gettime`, `gettimeofday`, `time`, the sleeps,
  `setitimer` and the timeouts of `poll`, `select`, `epoll_wait`,
  `pthread_cond_timedwait` and `sem_timedwait`/`sem_clockwait` in node time.
  A raw `rdtsc`, a `clock_gettime` made by system call, or a wait none of
  those is does not move with the run.
- **It opens its link early**, before anything in it waits on time:
  `simradio_station_open` is where its clock starts and the shim attaches;
  until the ether's welcome the monotonic clocks read 0 and the wall clocks
  the run's epoch.
- **It says when it is idle, and until when.** Idle is every thread blocked;
  the `until` it reports is the earliest wake anything in it holds
  (`simradio_wake_at`). Either the host calls `simradio_idle()` itself, a
  scheduler's idle with a wake at its next due tick and timer, or its driver
  sets `SIM_MESH_IDLE=threads` and the shim keeps a census of its threads. A
  station that says neither is reported idle by the radio library's
  watchdog, 20 ms of wall time after every message once none of its threads
  is on the CPU: it runs, but crawls.
- **It reads its console and talks TCP to other stations through the C
  library**: `read` on descriptor 0, and `read`/`recv`/`send`/`write` on its
  sockets. The shim counts those bytes for the ether, which holds T until a
  station has read what it was sent. Input taken another way holds T a
  second of wall time each time.

In return, nothing the ether says reaches the host piecemeal. The radio
library applies a datagram whole, the chip's own timers running as T moves,
before the host is told of any of it: the host's waits that fall due,
`simradio_on_advance` and DIO1 come after, so a thread woken at T finds all
of T.

## 6. The driver

The driver is a Python module in the zip, imported by sim-mesh from the
installed firmware's directory under a module name of its own. It **must**
define `DRIVER`, a subclass of its category's driver class (§7), which
subclasses `sim_mesh.driver.Driver`. It **must** import from sim-mesh only
`sim_mesh.driver` and its category's module; anything else in sim-mesh may
change under it. sim-mesh makes one `DRIVER(firmware)` per installed
firmware a run uses, shared by its stations.

**What a driver is given.** `self.firmware`: `dir`, `exec`, `fixed`, `env`
(paths made absolute), `driver`, `name`/`firmware`, `base`, `arch`,
`version`, `category`, `radio`, `title`, `hardware`. Every call names a
`station`, which offers:

| | |
|---|---|
| `name`, `node_id` | the node's name and its id |
| `dir`, `addr`, `ether_addr` | its directory, loopback address, the ether |
| `board` | `SIM_MESH_BOARD`'s JSON, or None |
| `log_path` | the file its console output is appended to |
| `status` | `stopped`, `starting`, `setup`, `up`, `restarting` |
| `starts` | how many times its process has been started |
| `virtual` | True in a virtual-time run |
| `rpc` | framed RPC on its console, or None before its process starts |
| `await sleep(s)` | a wait on the run's clock (T in virtual time) |
| `await restart()` | its process stopped, for the supervisor to start again |
| `report(event, **fields)` | an event into the run's `events.jsonl` at the run's T |

And from `sim_mesh.driver`: `CommandError` (anything that could not be done;
its text is shown as it is), `run_tool(argv, timeout, env=None)` (a helper
program to completion, `env` added to sim-mesh's environment),
`chip_dbm(board, connector_dbm)` (the chip power that puts that much at the
connector through the board's front end), `parse_setting`, `UP`, and the
framed RPC constants.

**What a driver implements.**

| Method | |
|---|---|
| `configured(station)` | **required**: True when the station's directory shows it has been set up. sim-mesh samples it at the fork; a station not set up is set up once it is up |
| `async wait_up(station, timeout)` | **required**: True once the station has booted and every service is up; False after `timeout` seconds of the run's clock |
| `argv(station)` | the command line; `[exec]` |
| `env(station)` | what it adds to the environment; nothing |
| `sids(station)`, `console_sid(station)` | the ether ids of its processes, and of the one reading the console; the node's own |
| `async run(station, line)` | a line in the firmware's own language (a script's `exec`, **Run command**); what it said back |
| `async flush(station)` | make what it was told durable, or apply it; asked after setup, before a stop, a reset or a snapshot |
| `web_port()` | its web UI's port; None |
| `console_line(station, line)` | a callback: each line the station prints, in order |
| `role_volatile` | True for a firmware that forgets its role at a restart: the role its first-boot rules gave it is said again at every boot |
| `console_tty` | False for a firmware whose console need not be a terminal: it gets a pipe each way instead of a pty, and its output must reach the pipe line by line; True |
| `console_acted_on` | False for a firmware whose console is log lines alone, nothing sim-mesh acts on (no framed RPC): its console is read as it comes rather than before T moves on, which a large run is much faster for. `console_line` is called either way; True |

Its helpers: `await self.pause(station, s)`, a wait on the run's clock;
`await self.joined(station, timeout)`, True once the station has joined the
ether, at the T of its hello (at once in a real-time run), so what the
driver does next it does at that T; `with self.tool_turn(station):` around a
tool run against the station's host door, during which T stands while the
tool has the floor and runs while the station works on what it read;
`await self.rpc_ready(station, timeout, marker_wait_s)` and
`await self.rpc_query(station, line, timeout=None)`, framed RPC.

**Framed RPC on the console.**

```
station → sim-mesh   "… framed rpc v1"                        once, early in boot, as log text
sim-mesh → station   F5 53 47 01 <id> <len:2> <a command line>
station → sim-mesh   F5 53 47 01 <id> <len:2> <what it printed>
```

A firmware **may** multiplex a framed side channel onto its console: a frame
is never echoed and never enters its line editor, and sim-mesh takes each
reply frame out of the stream, so the log and the console window never see
one. One frame is in flight per station; a command line is at most 4096
bytes; the id is a hash of the command, so a retry carries the one it had
([Framed RPC on the console](https://github.com/sim-mesh/sim-mesh#framed-rpc-on-the-console)).

## 7. The `reticulum` category

A firmware of category `reticulum` is a Reticulum node. Its `DRIVER`
subclasses `sim_mesh.reticulum.driver.ReticulumDriver` and implements these
verbs, each taking the station first: every firmware's (`name`, `radio`,
`radio_up`, `tx_power`, `diagnostics`, from `sim_mesh.driver.Driver`), then
the category's. A verb it cannot do raises `CommandError`
(`self.cannot(verb)`), which the default does. A script reaches the
category's as `<selection>.reticulum.<verb>`, and they are nothing to a
station of another category.

| Verb | Means | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `name(name)` | the node's name | |
| `role(role)` | `transport` (forwards others' traffic) or `client` | |
| `radio(freq_mhz=, sf=, bw_khz=, cr=, tx_dbm=, sync=, preamble=)` | slot 0's LoRa settings, only those given; `tx_dbm` at the antenna connector | |
| `radio_up()` | the radio started, for a firmware whose radio waits for it; nothing otherwise (default) | |
| `tx_power(dbm)` | transmit power at the connector | |
| `path(dest=None, iface=None)` | | its path table, `[{dest, next_hop, iface, hops}]`: the entries for `dest` (32 hex digits) and on `iface` (as the firmware names it) when given, all without |
| `peer_tcp(addr, port)` | a TCP link to another station | |
| `current_role()` | | `transport`, `client`, or None (default) |
| `diagnostics()` | | {label: text}, what a traffic run keeps of it; {} (default) |
| `lxmf.create(name)` | one more LXMF identity, `name` its display name, unless the station has one by that name. **Must not** refuse: a firmware with one identity, named after the node from its start, gives it `name`, and once it has another name does nothing | its delivery address, or None while it has none |
| `lxmf.identities()` | | `[(name, delivery address)]`, the one it sends from unless told otherwise first; `[]` while it has none |
| `lxmf.announce(name=None)` | an announce of that identity's delivery destination (None: the first) | |
| `lxmf.send(dest, text, mid, sender=None)` | an LXMF message to `dest` (32 hex digits) from its identity `sender` (None: the first); `mid` is sim-mesh's id for it | |

A verb with a dot is the method with an underscore: `lxmf.send` is
`lxmf_send`.

**Events.** For every message `lxmf.send` was given, the driver **must**
report how it ended, under `mid`, from `console_line` or however else it
learns it:

```
self.lxmf_status(station, mid, "delivered")
self.lxmf_status(station, mid, "failed", why=<text>)
```

and **may** report the statuses between (`pending`, `sent`); the last one
reported is what a traffic report shows for a message that never arrived.
Each is the event `lxmf.message.status` with `mid`, `status` and `why`. A
firmware's own id for a message is coupled to `mid` with
`self.lxmf_couple(station, mid, its_id)` once the driver learns it, and what
the station says under its own id is given to
`self.lxmf_native(station, its_id, status, why)`, which reports it under
`mid`, holding it until the coupling is made; what goes wrong before the
firmware has an id is reported under `mid` directly. sim-mesh writes each
event as a line of the run's `events.jsonl`:
`{"t": <T in µs>, "node": …, "event": …, …fields}`.

## 8. The ether's protocol

The ether is the medium between stations: it decides who hears each frame,
from the run's loss tables, and in a virtual-time run it owns time. A
station speaks to it over UDP, one JSON object per datagram, from a socket
bound to its own address; payloads are base64, times in microseconds. The
virtual radio (§9) speaks it for a firmware; a firmware **may** speak it
itself ([the ether's README](https://github.com/sim-mesh/sim-mesh/blob/main/ether/README.md)
has the whole of it).

A real-time run:

```
station → ether   hello {sid, slots}
ether → station   welcome {t, mode: "real", rate: 1, epoch, seed}
station → ether   state {slot, mode, mod, freq, bw, sf, cr, sync, hdr, crc, pre}   on every change
station → ether   tx {slot, id, t0, t_pre, t_hdr, t_end, power_dbm, mod, freq, bw, sf, …, payload}
ether → station   rx_begin {slot, id, t0, t_pre, t_hdr, t_end, level[, cad]}    each receiver it reaches
ether → station   rx_end {slot, id, verdict, payload, rssi, snr}               at the frame's end
```

A virtual-time run is the same conversation with the ether as conductor:

```
station → ether   hello {sid, slots}
ether → station   welcome {t, mode: "virtual", rate, epoch, seed, seq: 1}
station → ether   idle {seq: 1, until: 25000}            nothing to do before T 25 000
ether → station   run {t: 25000, seq: 2}                 every station idle; T moves to 25 000
station → ether   state {…}  tx {t0: 25000, …}           what it did at 25 000
station → ether   idle {seq: 2, until: 30000}
ether → station   rx_begin {t: 25000, seq: 7, …}         to each receiver, at the same T
receiver → ether  idle {seq: 7, until: …}
```

| Station → ether | Says |
|---|---|
| `hello` | this station exists, and which radio slots it has; `"lines": 1`, it takes several messages to a datagram: in a virtual-time run it is sent every message the barrier has for it at one go |
| `state` | a slot's mode (`RX`, `TX`, `CAD`, `STDBY_RC`, `SLEEP` …), its modulation `mod` and its carrier: the ether matches receivers on these |
| `tx` | a transmission: its modulation and carrier, its power at the connector, its instants (start, end of preamble, of header, end), its payload |
| `idle` | virtual time: done with everything message `seq` gave it; next needs to run at T `until` (null: not on its own) |
| `read`, `wrote`, `listen` | virtual time: bytes taken from its console or from another station over TCP, about to be written to one (with `go`: waits for the ether's `go`), and a TCP endpoint it listens on; the time shim sends these |

| Ether → station | Says |
|---|---|
| `welcome` | joined: `t`, `mode` (`real` or `virtual`), `rate`, `epoch`, `seed` |
| `rx_begin` | a frame is arriving: its instants and its level; `cad: true` when it is energy to this station, not a frame to demodulate |
| `rx_end` | that frame is over: the verdict (`clean`, `crc`), the payload, RSSI and SNR |
| `run` | virtual time: T has reached what this station asked for, or it has input to work on |
| `go` | virtual time: a TCP write asked for may go ahead |

- **`mod`** is the modulation; a receiver hears only a frame in its own. The
  ether models `lora` (with `bw`, `sf`, `cr`, `sync`, `hdr`, `crc`, `pre`);
  a `state` or `tx` naming another is refused. It does not model preamble
  length.
- The `id` in a `tx` is the transmitter's own count; in `rx_begin` and
  `rx_end` it is the ether's, unique across stations.
- **Virtual time.** Every message the ether sends carries `t` and `seq`; the
  station applies it at that T and answers with an `idle` for that `seq`,
  and messages are applied strictly in `seq` order, never twice. T moves
  only when every station is idle, to the earliest of their `until`s and the
  air's next instant. An idle is said again every 250 ms of wall time until
  something comes back; the ether answers an idle for an older `seq` said
  twice by sending what came after it again. A station that says `hello`
  again has restarted.
- Unknown message types are ignored, on both sides.

## 9. The virtual radio

A virtual radio is a model of one radio chip on a virtual SPI bus, and the
station's link to the ether, as a shared library sim-mesh provides:
`libsimradio-sx1262.so` is the SX1262. A firmware is compiled against its
header,
[`radio/include/simradio.h`](https://github.com/sim-mesh/sim-mesh/blob/main/radio/include/simradio.h),
and linked with it **by name** (`-lsimradio-sx1262`), and **must not** carry
it: sim-mesh puts its own on the station's `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, so a firmware
keeps working when the model or the ether's protocol changes, and only a
change to `simradio.h` itself needs it rebuilt. It makes the simulation and
the hardware do the same thing: the firmware's own driver talks SPI to it
frame by frame, exactly as to the chip on a board.

```c
int  simradio_station_open(int sid, const char *bind_addr, const char *ether_addr);  /* once, early */
simradio_t *simradio_open(int slot, void (*on_pin)(void *ctx, int pin, int level), void *ctx);
void simradio_transfer(simradio_t *, const uint8_t *out, size_t len, uint8_t *in);    /* one NSS cycle */
void simradio_reset(simradio_t *);                                                    /* RST's rising edge */
int  simradio_pin(simradio_t *, int pin);                    /* SIMRADIO_PIN_DIO1, SIMRADIO_PIN_BUSY */
void simradio_set_services(const struct simradio_services *); /* a host's own, before anything else */

int     simradio_virtual(void);          int64_t simradio_node_us(void);
int     simradio_joined(void);           int64_t simradio_node_at_join(void);
int64_t simradio_epoch_us(void);         int64_t simradio_node_to_conductor(int64_t node_us);
int     simradio_wake_create(void (*due)(void *), void *arg);
void    simradio_wake_at(int wake, int64_t node_us);           /* INT64_MAX clears it */
void    simradio_idle(void);
void    simradio_on_advance(void (*moved)(void));
```

- **Open the link once, early**: `simradio_station_open(SIM_MESH_NODE_ID,
  SIM_MESH_BIND_ADDR, SIM_MESH_ETHER)`, before anything waits on time (§5);
  then `simradio_open(slot, …)` per radio.
- **One whole frame per NSS cycle.** A bus adapter hands the model
  everything the driver put on the bus between NSS going low and going high
  as one frame: writes inside a frame are appended, never passed on one by
  one; a frame containing a read is complete at the read; the adapter never
  adds a NOP of its own. A reassembly one byte off makes `GetIrqStatus` read
  the status byte as the IRQ word's high byte, so every flag looks set.
- **Interrupts.** `on_pin` runs on whatever thread moved the line. A pin
  shim whose interrupt is level-triggered **must** fire at once when the
  interrupt is enabled while the line is asserted: a driver that disables
  its interrupt, drains, and re-enables relies on a line still high
  re-firing.
- **The host's services.** The library needs a clock, one-shot timers, a
  recursive lock, a UDP socket and a thread to read it, and a log
  (`struct simradio_services` in the header). Its own are a plain process's
  threads; a host with a scheduler of its own (FreeRTOS on ESP-IDF's Linux
  target) **must** hand it its own with `simradio_set_services` before any
  other call (a constructor is the place), so model callbacks run as that
  host's tasks.
- **The front end** is the library's: what the chip radiates goes through
  `SIM_MESH_BOARD`'s transmit curve before the ether is told its power, and
  every level the chip reads is the front end's receive gain above the
  connector's. A firmware that drives a front end converts with the same
  figures.

## 10. Building against it

Start sim-mesh once first (`sim`, which builds its radio and leaves
`radio/build/libsimradio-sx1262.so`), then build the station for Linux:

```sh
# C or C++
cc station.c -I sim-mesh/radio/include -L sim-mesh/radio/build -lsimradio-sx1262 -lpthread -o station

# Rust: link it by name from a build script
println!("cargo:rustc-link-search=native={}/build", radio_dir);
println!("cargo:rustc-link-lib=dylib=simradio-sx1262");

# PlatformIO on Portduino: sim-mesh's radio/portduino library, in lib_deps as
#   symlink://<path to sim-mesh>/radio/portduino
# links the radio by name and stands in for spidev and libgpiod
```

Then make the zip: the executable, the driver, anything else it runs, the
shared libraries beyond the C library and C++ runtime under `lib/`, and
`node.yaml`. Check what the executable loads with `ldd`: everything but
`libc`, `libm`, `libstdc++`, `libgcc_s`, the loader and `libsimradio-*`
belongs in `lib/`. Then `sim firmware add` it, and run a script with it. A
firmware that publishes its zips puts them on
[the pre-built list]({{ '/firmware/' | relative_url }}) with sim-mesh's
`tools/deploy-firmware`.

## 11. A whole example

`node.yaml`:

```yaml
base: relay-sx1262
arch: aarch64
version: '20261001120000'
category: reticulum
radio: sx1262
title: Relay (dev)
hardware: ESP32-S3
exec: relay
driver: driver.py
fixed: fixed
env:
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH: ./lib
```

`driver.py`, for a firmware that answers framed RPC on its console:

```python
import os
import re

from sim_mesh.reticulum.driver import ReticulumDriver

QUEUED = re.compile(r"queued (\S+)")
MID = re.compile(r"mid=(\S+)")


class Relay(ReticulumDriver):
    def configured(self, station):
        return os.path.exists(os.path.join(station.dir, "state", "boot"))

    async def wait_up(self, station, timeout):
        return await self.rpc_ready(station, timeout, 20.0)

    async def run(self, station, line, timeout=None):
        return await self.rpc_query(station, line, timeout)

    async def name(self, station, name):
        await self.run(station, "hostname %s" % name)

    async def lxmf_create(self, station, name):
        return None                 # one identity, there from its start

    async def lxmf_identities(self, station):
        address = (await self.run(station, "address")).strip()
        return [(station.name, address)] if address else []

    async def lxmf_announce(self, station, name=None):
        await self.run(station, "announce")

    async def lxmf_send(self, station, dest, text, mid, sender=None):
        found = QUEUED.search(await self.run(station, "send %s %s" % (dest, text)))
        if not found:
            self.lxmf_status(station, mid, "failed", "not queued")
            return
        self.lxmf_couple(station, mid, found.group(1))

    def console_line(self, station, line):
        found = MID.search(line)
        if found and "delivered" in line:
            self.lxmf_native(station, found.group(1), "delivered")
        elif found and "failed" in line:
            self.lxmf_native(station, found.group(1), "failed", line)


DRIVER = Relay
```
