title: Getting started
description: Clone sim-mesh, start it, add firmware, and run a first simulation.
---

sim-mesh needs no firmware tree: stations are firmware zips, added from a
file or from the [pre-built ones]({{ '/firmware/' | relative_url }}).

It needs **Docker or Podman** and nothing else, on Linux, a Mac or Windows:
`sim` builds its own image on first use (a few minutes, once) and runs
everything inside it, with port 8800 published.

## 1. Clone it

The directory you clone into is the one `sim` mounts into its image, so
a firmware tree put beside sim-mesh later can build against its radio:

```sh
mkdir mesh && cd mesh
git clone https://github.com/sim-mesh/sim-mesh.git
```

## 2. Start it

```sh
sim-mesh/sim
```

It builds whichever of the page, the virtual radios and the planner is not
built yet or is older than its sources (the first time, several minutes),
starts the front and opens `http://localhost:8800/`. The terminal is the
testbed's: Ctrl-C there stops every simulation and everything they started.
`sim run SCRIPT …` starts one in the background instead when none is running,
and opens the page on the run.

## 3. Add firmware

On the **Firmware** tab, **Add from pre-built…** lists what this site offers
for your machine's architecture and installs one with a click; **Add from
zip…** installs a zip of your own. From a shell:

```sh
sim-mesh/sim firmware prebuilt               # what sim-mesh.net offers this machine
sim-mesh/sim firmware add <a zip, or its URL>
sim-mesh/sim firmware list
```

## 4. Ground and nodes

Geodata and nodesets are fetched from an index or made here. On the
**Geodata** tab, **Download pre-built geodata packs** lists what sim-mesh's own
index and any you add offer, and **Add** installs one; or make ground —
**Build…** over a rectangle of the map, or **New synthetic…** — and click it
to choose it. On the **Nodes** tab place nodes on it, **Import…** them in
the Layers panel from a public node map or a file, or fetch a nodeset under
**Nodesets…**, and **Save nodes as nodeset…**. [Simulation]({{ '/simulation/' | relative_url }})
says what each of those is.

## 5. A first simulation

On the **Scripts** tab open `lxmf-traffic`, choose the firmware its nodes
run in **Firmware for nodes not otherwise configured** above the script, and
**Run…** it: a new simulation of the nodeset on that ground, in virtual time.
The page goes over to the simulation's live map and its stations come up;
rings on the map are frames on the air. When it is done the simulation is
paused and its **Report** says how much of an hour of messages arrived.

For a simulation to work with by hand, run `realtime`: every node on the
chosen firmware, on the wall clock, set up and left running.

## 6. Play with it

- **Click a station** for its editor, its **Console** (its serial console)
  and **Web UI** (its own web interface, for a firmware that serves one).
- **Right-click the map ▸ New node here** puts down a station. It comes up
  and is set up on its own.
- **Drag a station** and its links change once its row of the loss table is
  recomputed.
- **Right-click a station ▸ Run command…** types one line at the selected
  stations, in their firmware's own language.
- **Pause** on the simulation's row of the Simulations tab stops it with its
  state kept; **Resume** (▶) starts it again as it ended, in real time, and
  a script run on a paused one resumes it in the script's own time.
  **Stop** ends a simulation for good, a paused one's state deleted.
- **⋯ ▸ Save snapshot as…** keeps the network and everything its stations
  have become, and **⋯ ▸ Load snapshot into it…** brings one back.
